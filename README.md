# LieWave: Lie Detection Using Speech Processing Techniques

## Project Description
LieWave is a mobile application designed to detect lies by analyzing speech patterns using advanced machine learning models. By processing audio inputs, it identifies subtle cues in tone, pace, and linguistic features to provide a real-time lie probability score. This tool can assist in improving communication, enhancing decision-making, and offering valuable insights in various scenarios without relying on visual or facial data.
